Description: This package simulates trait data in a structured hierarchical
    sampling design, where observations ("leaves") are nested within individuals
    ("trees"), and individuals within "sites" or populations. It provides tools
    for visualizing power of different sampling strategies to detect differences
    among populations. The package simulates data under means and covariances
    (at the tree and site level) based on empirical data provided by the user.
    Thus it can serve as a tool for planning empirical studies based on preliminary
    data.
